This returned ""Paghman Mount"" within the range (34.646535, 68.886517) I used this as the midpoint and measured along the mountain range around it to find the furthest point where there are continuous mountains. I also found literature which described the mountain range extent (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=29bg7g1U6coC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=paghman+range+afghanistan&source=bl&ots=boNEEM2KIA&sig=eRGz1pTlIheSGO1JDya4qFkuqwI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSpLC6xbDZAhVpAcAKHZBAAjsQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&q=paghman%20range%20afghanistan&f=false), but unfortunately the exact extent of the range was difficult to determine as this book says ""The Paghman range projects south-westwards to separate the basin of the river helmand from that of the Arhandab and extends into the arid southern Afghanistan"" but it was very difficult to estimate where it separated the basins and how far it extended into the ""arid southern Afghanistan"". So, seeing Paghman Mount is very close to the town of Paghman and is on a mountain range, I have used the mount as the midpoint and measured the extent to the furthest point of the visible range using terrain view on google maps. This makes the extent 55.23 km (extent from midpoint to 35.088478, 69.171955) and within the radius of this, elevation points within the given range will be included. The AMNH also lists these specimens locality information but also adds a little more (http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Caudata/Hynobiidae/Hynobiinae/Afghanodon/Afghanodon-mustersi), the record for this species explains that Brame, 1972 (Checklist Living & Fossil Salamand. World (Unpubl. MS)) gives the type locality as ""mountain streams of the Paghman Range, above Paghman [=17 mi. W Kabul], at between 9000 and 10,000 feet altitude"", Afghanistan.î As ñPaghman Mountî is found close to Paghman and near Paghman River and the extent includes these elevations I have set the certainty score at 75% as it is likely the specimen was found within the extent.

I looked up salamander species in Thailand using the ñcountry searchî feature on Amphibiaweb.org then looked at these species within ïSalamanders of the old worldÍ (Sparreboom, 2014). The species found in Thailand (Tylotriton sp.) shared very little morphological similarities to P. persimilis. I then looked at A. jeffersonianum and P.glutinosus identification information in ïSalamanders of the United States and Canada (Petranka, 1998). As suggested by Jeff this provided information regarding the costal grooves which I could then count in erroneous specimen and non-type specimens of A.jeffersonianum and P.glutinosus to look for similarities, according to the books, the former has 12-13 costal grooves and the latter has an average of 16. I then retrieved the type specimen (x2 in on jar) (which also said it could be Amblystoma persimile- but both are A. jeffersoanianum on amnh.org) and the best preserved examples of P.glutinosus (1957.1.8.10-12) & A. jeffersonianum (1957.1.7.26-27) and compared their costal groove number to the Plethodon persimilis specimen.

The type specimensÍ costal grooves were then counted appeared to total 11/13 (depending ifPetranka (1998) followed)( also difficult to distinguish due to state of specimen). To reaffirm the decision that the specimen in error was in fact A.jeffersonianum I checked the author links disputing the specimens localities online (http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Caudata/Ambystomatidae/Ambystoma/Ambystoma-jeffersonianum). Noble (1926) stated that this specimen (described by Gray, 1859) was recognised as A. jeffersonianum and that Boulenger (1882) found differences between the original specimen and the latter, but they (the author) recently examined it and compared it to juvenile A.jeffersonianum specimens and did not find these same morphological differences. Instead they found it to be incredibly similar to A.jeffersonianum and also discussed how the two specimens at the museum are recorded as ñhaving been purchased from ñMr. Stevensî and are presumed to have formed part of the collection of reptiles and amphibians made by Mouhot in Siamî, they say that Mr. Stevens is probably ñMr. Samuel Stevensî whom Mouhot mentions in his book. Mr Stevens was a sales man and auctioneer of natural history objects so Mouhot probably sold his collection to him and it was then sold to the British Museum. The author says the specimens probably werenÍt sent straight from the field to the museum ñbut passed through other handsî and that ñanyone who has had much business with even the most careful of natural history dealers knows how frequently specimens are erroneously labelledî. They summarise; whilst the P.persimilis specimens could have come from ñLouang Prahang- the mountainous region of southern Yunnan, into which Mouhot had penetrated at the time of his deathî, no amphibian collections have since come from this region (but could be just like cases of discontinuous distribution in Hydromantes, Cryptobranchus and Megalobatrachus), but that the species may exist there. The author does then say that without further data itÍs probable that GrayÍs specimens never came from Siam, but were mislabelled in transit (http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/4297//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N0212.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).With evidence from visual checks and the literature I therefore concluded that this specimenÍs locality must be in error and that the best thing to do would be to map the range of Ambystoma jeffersonianum for it. The range is described from (Petranka, 1998) (p.58) where it is described as ñdeciduous forests from New England south and south-westward to Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginiaî.

I placed a midpoint at 700.59km (41.373887, -79.642049) between the two points and this also acted as the extent which I traced out across the map to ensure it would encompass all of the described range.

This georeference was treated like ""Offset at a heading"" within the NHM protocol, but rather than measuring to the nearest place name, I took it to the just past the elevation point to encompass the elevation stated within the species description to try and encompass the original collection point. The certainty score is high as it is likely the specimen was collected within this area as the description is detailed and I could pinpoint the locations within it.

I first georeferenced the mountains: The Zagros Mountains is now a mountain range that covers the Iranian plateu (not Persia). Wikipedia showed that itÍs a 1,500km stretch of mountains that start at Lake Urmia and go to the straits of Hormuz at the entrance of the Persian Gulf (https://heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/zagros/index.htm). I looked these localities up on google maps, however their point localities were rather random so I dropped a pin at the most southern point of Lake Urmia to indicate the start of the mountain range (38.213175, 45.115672) and did the same at the furthest south point where the mountains ""begin"" just above the Persian gulf (27.566922, 56.844364) (=1,608.40km). I then took the midpoint (804.2km) which gave the coordinates and extent. Certainty score shows that the specimens should have been collected in this large area where the extent has also been overestimated from the original ""1,500km"" to encompass the mountain range.  But then I found further information: After investigating other newt species in the surrounding area, I came across literature that detailed this species locality further. The amnh.org page for this species http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Caudata/Salamandridae/Pleurodelinae/Neurergus/Neurergus-kaiseri showed that the type locality is ñ""Shah Bazan, Luristan, Iran"", Zagros Mountains, 1200 meters, from 10 to 15 km south of the junction of the Ab-I-Cesar and Ab-I-Diz riversî and that ñMuseum records give locality as ""Locality 70: 'Good Springs' 11km N of Shah Bazan, 8 km SW of junction with Ab-i-Diz and Ab-i-Cezar river""î. However, these localities were incredibly hard to find as although the Ab-i-Diz (ñDezî) river exists, there were no documents or map localities found for Abi-i-Cezar. Sharifi Sharifi et al (2013) describes the type specimenÍs localities as they were done in the original documentation (Schmidt, 1952) ñNeurergus kaiseri, KaiserÍs Mountain Newt (Fig. 1), was first described as a subspecies of N. crocatus from two streams surrounding Shahbazan rail station, Lorestan Province, Iran (Schmidt 1952). The first of these streams is Shahbazan stream, located 8 km southwest of Ab-I-Cezar (Dez River) at approximately 1,200 m elevation. The other location is 8 km north- northeast of the upper part of the Tove Stream at a spring emerging from a cave at 1,000 m elevation (Schmidt 1952). This paper gave ñgeneralised coordinatesî for these localities which I explored on google maps. I could find a set of coordinates for Shahb?zan and the rail station there (32.783368, 48.650007) (midpoint) (https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4344838&fid=2846&c=iran)(32Á 47' 00"" N, 48Á 39' 00"" E). To encompass both localities given in the documentation (Tove 32.8 _ N, 48.7 _ E 1000m & Shahbazan 32.8 _ N, 48.6 _ E, 1200m) and their elevations, using the extent tool on google maps I measured out from Shabazan to 1200m in all directions and recorded the furthest distance (32.806775, 48.278608), this ensured that both localities were encompassed in the extent parameter and reduced this distance from the first recording by a great amount. The latter information was for the type specimen, but the museum has the paratype, therefore I could not use the more precise georeferenced locality without proving that both specimens were found at the same time/place. Luckily, the museum holds reprints of many herpetologists published work. I searched through Karl P. SchmidtÍs work and came across the book ñAmphibians and Reptiles from Iranî (Schmidt, K. P. 1952) which I had been looking for online. It was reprinted from Vidensk. Medd. Fra Dansk naturh. Foren., bd. 117, 1955. Schmidt writes ñthe amphibians and reptiles collected in Iran by the Danish botanists and zoologists in the course of the Danish Scientific Investigations in Iran were entrusted to me for critical identification and report by Dr. F.W. Braestrup, of the Universitetets Zoologiske Museum at Copenhagen, with the consent of Professor Dr. R. Sparck, then head of the vertebrate department, in 1938î. ñIt was the intention of Mag. Sc. E. Kaiser to report on the series of salamanders collected by himself in Luristan, which he recognised as of especial interest; this he was unable to carry out on account of other duties. His specimens represent a distinct new subspecies of the remarkable Neurergus crocatus (Salamandridae), which I have named for him in recognition of major contributions to the herpetological collections made by the groupî. He described the specimenÍs location as: ñShah Bazan, about 11km N. of, i.e. 8km SW of the junction of Abi-i-Cezar with Abi-i-Diz. ñGood springsî. (As far as the collector ascertained these springs are not among the sources of Tuba Creek, from which they are well isolated), ab. 1200m, Apr. 28, 1937, male type (03184), female allotype (03182) and 7 further adults (03183, 03185-87, 1 in British museum, 2 in Chicago Mus.), several larvae (03201)î. Along with other specimens from different pools Shah Bazan, ab .8km NNE of, upper part of Tuba Creek valley, at a spring emerging from a sort of cave, Mansu Abad, about 1200m (Tuba Creek is a small affluent to the right bank of Abi-i-Diz), Apr. 27, 1937, 2 ad. (03188-89).î ñOne of the sources of Tuba Creek in the neighbourhood of the village called Tuba, probably about 750m., Apr. 25, 1937, 6 adults (03190-95), 5 larvae (03200).î ñOne of the uppermost sources of Tuba Creek. A Moindjah, probably about 1000m, Apr.26, 1937, 1 adult (Chicago Mus.), 4 larvae (03196-99).î Then there is a photo of Neurergus crocatus kaiseri- showing the dorsal view of ñtype (right) and paratypeî. The pages also describe the salamanderÍs morphology and a map of the localities of collection in the Zagros Mts, ñwhere most of the specimens were collectedî.  For the specimen located at the museum, again the type locality is: ñShah Bazan, about 11km N. of, i.e. 8km SW of the junction of Ab-i-Cezar with Ab-i-Diz. ñGood Springsî. ñab. 1200mî. I used the hand drawn map of the area within the book to follow the Abi-i-Diz river (Dez river) up from Shah Bazan towards Tangeh Haft to look for the split indicated in the description by comparing the drawn map to Google Maps satellite imagery of the area (found that Abi-i-cezar river is now named Sezar river). The split as indicated in the map was not prominent on Google Maps and the closest I found to it was a split where the Abi-i-Diz (or Dez river) is intercepted by the Sezar river at Tang-e-Panj (32.944623, 48.745294). I decided to measure the extent out from Shah Bazan to the distance given in the original description ñShah Bazan, about 11km N. of, i.e. 8km SW of the junction of Abi-i-Cezar with Abi-i-Diz. ñGood springsî ab. 1200mî, so I kept the midpoint at Shah Bazan and measured 12km north (32.891355, 48.649055) to encompass the first point and hopefully cover the  second lots of directions within the extent. I also ensured that the area covered encapsulated areas with elevations of and around 1200m using ñterrainî view on Google Maps. The extent being measured to 12km from Shah Bazan also meant that it was around 8km SW of Tang-e-Panj where I think the river split occurs, I have therefore given this point a high certainty score as it encompasses all parts of the description, but I cannot be 100% sure that the specimen is found here.

A Manual of British Vertebrate Animals.  Cambridge: Pitt Press. However, in Lataste, F. 1877. (Sur l'habitat du Triton vittatus, Gray; et sur l'idientification de cette espece avec le Triton ophryticus, Berthold. Bulletin de la Soci_t_ Zoologique de France 2: 359_372) the species original location(s) is discussed (translated from french and summarised): ""I do not know which of L. Jenyns (A Manual of british vertebrate animals 1835) or Gu_rin de Mnewlle {Iconography of the reign animal, 1829-1844) first mentioned Triton viitatus,none of these two authors being cited by the other.Guerin (loc cit, III, p.17) tells us that the ""Triton vittatus, Valenciennes, ColL Museum, lives in Syria ""; and we gives the figure, drawn by Oudart, of a beautiful male of this species, the same subject from the Paris Museum. Jenyns tells us about the Triton vittatus, Gray: ""New (made?) This discovery in parks near London by Mr. J.-E. Gray. "" Note, by the way, that it's really Gray that comes back paternity of the name of vittatus, this author having thus named samples of the London Museum, in 1830 after Gray himself and as early as 1820, while Valenciennes, as we will see later, had first called Molge syriacm the examples plies of the Paris Museum.In 1839, Thomas Bell (A History of British Reptiles) finished thus the article devoted to the form he refers to as Triton palmxitus, which, it is worth noting, is only a variety of Triton punctatus: ""The most remarkable variety of this species is certainly that which has been described by Mr. Gray, and after him by Mr. Jenyns, as a distinct species, under the name of Triton vitta-""As to the rights of Triton vittatus to nationality English, they result from this fact, that it was found in the British Museum in a jar containing other English samples and bearing the name *England. So there is no reason to doubt his English origin; there is even reason to believe that we took him to a fort short distance from London. I then researched the species current range through the IUCN red list and could see that it was within syria, other synonyms of this species are also noted as from syria and turkey on AMNH, therefore I decided to use the country midpoint for syria given in the ""country centroid"" excel file (35.013134, 38.505131) and measured the extent (414.26km) out from the midpoint to the furthest point within the Syrian border. The certainty score shows that the specimen should be found within this large area, but that I'm not 100% certain due to the lack of information confirming this location as the type source. The online record and registration number indicate that there are two specimens in the bottle, however upon inspection of the label and provided data I could see that there were in fact three specimens.

I looked up this locality and thru species name and found ""Chinese Amphibians and reptiles in the United States National Museum"" (Stejneger, 1925). This stated how the original collector Pere David ""collected his specimens not far from Tsitou in the mountains of Southern Kiangsi near the border of Fukien"". I was unable to locate ""Tsitou"" so used the information given to create a midpoint and extent. Fukien is now known as Fujian, this runs along the east/south side of Kiangsi, I roughly estimated the midpoint of Kiangsi (27.333404, 115.491170) (by measuring furthest northpoint- to furthest south within border) (~640km, so mid ~320km) and focused on the border running down the East-South side. I selected a portion of the border parallel to the mid-province point and measured to where the most southern point of Kiangsi which is after where the meeting borders end (27.297400, 117.109385-24.583318, 115.832667) and took the midpoint (25.986882, 116394414) by dividing this length (full length=331.90km) in two, the extent (165.95km) would then encapsulate a good deal of land near the border of Fukien in Southern Kiangsi as the description suggests.

I looked for both localities, but was unable to track down Gongwa even though I found literature that referred to it (http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=1008748-1). To find the syntype locality I researched information from AMNH and on the specimen bottle. Three Valleys mentioned in literature: Nantin (also on bottle), Momien, and Hotha valleys, Western Yunan. Found mention of Nantin town and valley both in The Journal of the Royal Geographic Society Volume 41 (XLI), http://www.jstor.org/stable/3698062 (https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XVkMAAAAIAAJ). This is the record of an exhibition by Major E. B. Sladen from Burma through to SW China. Confirmed Nantin existed as a small town somewhere near the source of the Irawaddy, between the Myanmar (Burma) border and Momein (now known as Tengchong). From the records, Sladen's expedition went from West to East, and he refers to Momein as ""one more march"" away, from this I inferred that the location of the mentioned Nantin Village was no more than 25km West of Momein (Tengchong)[Suspected coords of Nantin Village: 25.048024, 98.166368, current day Nanzhanghe]. Anderson, J. (1871) - http://biostor.org/reference/51881 - also noted that the specimen was first found in a rice paddy around Nantin village, rather than in the wider valley area. (Midpoint figured out using Tengchong to burma initially, area narrowed down from here to include suspect valleys- now extent is from 25.048024, 98.166368- 25.024709, 98.507976 (34.58km) (extended from suggested 25km to encompass all areas of interest)). Certainty score reflects intensive investigation and wide area of possible collection point covered, but that there is still lack of definitive proof of collection point.
